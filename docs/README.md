# civil.css

A minimal, opinionated, and content-centric CSS library designed for perfectionists by harnessing the magic of modular scale, and vertical rhythm.

This is the documentation / project page for `civil.css`.

It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The structure was inspired by Michael Rose's ["Building a Style Guide with Jekyll"](https://mademistakes.com/articles/jekyll-style-guide/). Changes in this subdirectory are pushed from `master` to `gh-pages` using `git subtree push --prefix docs/ origin gh-pages`.
